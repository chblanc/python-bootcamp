# python-bootcamp
a collection of scripts intended to gain familiarity in coding data science
tasks in `python`.

# instructions
Pull down the repo and run `sh env/create-env` to create the development 
environment containing `python`, `R`, and `RStudio`. This will populate a
`.Rprofile` in the main directory which will ensure that the correct 
version of `python` is used with `reticulate`.  

once the installation finishes (~7 minutes) source the environment and run
`rstudio`: 

  `source activate python-bootcamp`
  `rstudio`

This will pop-open an `RStudio` session which you can use to open the project `R`
project file in the repo.
